# Disposable-runner package acquisition — 2026-11-11

Author: Jason Stys. Workflow availability hardening, not a proven DNS repair or product defect.

The exact merged-main source had already passed its clean Windows compiled functional journey. Its later main Validate run failed only in Ubuntu 3.12/3.14 APT installation of `python3-tk`, exit 100, before the affected source/native assertions. Actual logs explicitly report `Temporary failure resolving azure.archive.ubuntu.com`; requests to the configured official fallback locations also failed. This evidence does not establish an application failure, nor prove that changing mirrors cures the underlying resolver/network outage.

Only the disposable Ubuntu 24.04 runner acquisition path changes: confirm hosted Linux/x86_64/Ubuntu version and existing signed mirror-file/keyring contract, then select fixed official HTTPS archive/security mirrors. Existing suites, components and Ubuntu archive signature/keyring verification remain unchanged. APT acquisition uses zero retries and finite 15-second transport timeouts with effective configuration checked. Package names, test/native/sanitizer oracles, original job deadlines, signed hash checks and no-artifact/cache policy remain intact. No local PC DNS, host package source, SDK or Docker configuration is changed.

Actual-workflow regression mutants reject missing/late admission, missing signature guard, foreign mirror, added retries and unauthenticated installation. Full hosted checks must run on the new source; a local YAML policy/actionlint pass is not live APT/DNS evidence. If every official host remains unavailable, the workflow still fails rather than skipping tests, weakening authentication or retrying to obtain a green result.

Primary contracts: [Ubuntu Noble sources.list](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man5/sources.list.5.html), [APT mirror transport](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/apt/apt-transport-mirror.1.en.html). The mirror transport selects entries by priority and preserves repository authentication; it cannot guarantee DNS/network availability.

## Observed local follow-up

[Original failed main Validate run](https://github.com/JasonStys/disconnected-release-kit/actions/runs/43036256823). All seven authored-step policy cases, including six independent unsafe/missing/late mutations, passed. The complete unchanged local source/core suite passed 216 tests with 5 explicit Windows/platform-capability skips and 96.78% combined coverage against the unchanged 95% floor. Strict lint/types/maps, native actionlint and repository/privacy checks passed. These local checks do not establish hosted mirror availability; the new PR must pass all its actual hosted gates. The previously compiled clean-main app proof retains its original source identity and is not relabeled as the new workflow commit.
